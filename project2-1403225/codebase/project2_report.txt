2. Meta-data
- Show your meta-data design (Tables and Columns table) and information about each column.


3. Internal Record Format
- Show your record format design and describe how your design satisfies O(1) field access. If not, just mention that your team hasn't implemented this feature.


- Describe how you store a VarChar field.

	We store a VarChar field in two components, as specified: 4 bytes to store the length of the characters, then the list of characters stored.

- Describe how you deal with an update and delete.

	For updates, we first consider whether or not there is sufficient space in the record's current page to accommodate the update. If the change in size
	exceeds the available free space in the record's current page, then we just use insertRecord to add the new updated record, which implicitly finds the best
	page that can fit it. After inserting, we delete the original record and leave a forwarding address to the new RID in its place. If the record in question
	was already a forwarding address, then we replace it with the new one.
		Alternatively, if the change in size of the page is less than the amount of available free space, we move all records that come after it in the page,
	then rewrite the offsets in the slot directory accordingly. After that, it updates the record in question and updates the free space offset by the change
	in size of the page.
		Once the record is fully updated, we write it back to the page.

	For deletes, we call a separate function removeRecordFromPage(), which is separate since its functionality is utilized in multiple other functions for the
	RBFM such as updateRecord(). In removeRecordFromPage(), we empty out and delete the slot entry which corresponds to the record to be deleted. The record is
	then deleted by overwriting it with the successive records and increasing the free space offset by the size of the deleted record.
		Once the record is deleted, we write the changes back to the page.
