2. Internal Record Format
- Show your record format design and describe how your design satisfies O(1) field access.
If not, just mention that you haven't implemented this feature.


- Describe how you store a VarChar field.
We store a VarChar field in two components, as specified: 4 bytes to store the length of
the characters, then the list of characters stored.

3. Page Format
Our page format has a slot directory at the back which, starting from the back, contains an
offset to the start of the free space (4 bytes), the number of slots in use (4 bytes), and
then an offset (4 bytes) and record length (4 bytes) for each slot being used in the page.
The actual records are stored at the front and back of the page, growing towards the middle
as insertions are made. The free space is stored between the growing list of records on
either side.
